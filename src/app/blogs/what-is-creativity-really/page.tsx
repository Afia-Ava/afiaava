            <p>A screenwriter cold-emailed Mark Cuban asking for money to 3D-print rockets. Cuban wired half a million dollars within the week.</p>
            <p>Sounds like luck, right? Like one of those stories where someone just happened to be in the right place at the right time. But that&apos;s not what happened at all.</p>
            <p>Tim Ellis had spent years as a storyteller, writing screenplays and building narratives. Then he interned at Blue Origin and saw how rockets were made. Thousands of parts. Years of assembly. Billions of dollars. And he started asking a different kind of question. What if you didn&apos;t build them that way? What if you could 3D-print them instead?</p>
            <p>Most people would&apos;ve stopped there. It&apos;s a cool thought experiment. But Tim kept going. He teamed up with Jordan Noone and pitched the idea to Mark Cuban. Not because he had all the answers, but because he had a question worth exploring.</p>
            <p>That&apos;s where it starts. Curiosity. The &quot;what if&quot; that won&apos;t leave you alone. But curiosity alone doesn&apos;t build rockets. Tim and Jordan got their funding and rented a small space. They assembled a team. Started printing prototypes. And immediately hit a wall. Prints warped. Engines misfired. There were thousands of ways for this to fail, and they were finding all of them. Most people would&apos;ve called it impossible. But Tim saw something else. He saw constraints. And constraints force you to think differently.</p>
            <p>They couldn&apos;t build rockets the traditional way. They didn&apos;t have the resources or the time. So they had to simplify. Instead of thousands of parts, what if they printed rockets almost as single pieces? Fewer parts meant faster builds, lower costs, and more flexibility. The limitation became the innovation. And as they kept testing, something started happening. Patterns emerged. Certain designs held up better under stress. Some engine configurations were more reliable than others. Each test gave them information. Each failure pointed them somewhere new.</p>
            <p>That&apos;s when iteration kicks in. Hundreds of prints. Thousands of engine tests. Every failure wasn&apos;t a setback. It was data. And data compounds.</p>
            <p>After years of this, on March 22, 2023, Terran 1 launched. The world&apos;s first nearly fully 3D-printed rocket. It didn&apos;t make it to orbit because of a second-stage issue, but it flew. And for Tim and his team, that was enough. Every failed prototype, every warped print, every late night had led to this.</p>
            <p>Here&apos;s what I realized watching stories like this. Breakthroughs aren&apos;t magic. They&apos;re not random gifts that land on genius people. They follow a pattern.</p>
            <p>Curiosity &times; Constraints &times; Patterns, raised to the power of Iteration.</p>
            <p>You start with a question. The constraints force you to innovate. The patterns show you what works. And iteration compounds it all into something real.</p>
            <p>That&apos;s how a screenwriter builds rockets. That&apos;s how ideas become breakthroughs. Not through inspiration alone, but through structure. Through process. Through showing up and trying again.</p>
            <p>The people who change things aren&apos;t the ones who wait for the perfect idea. They&apos;re the ones who take an imperfect question and iterate until it works.</p>
